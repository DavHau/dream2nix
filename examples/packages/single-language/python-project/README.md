### Description 
Creates an isolated development enviroment for developing your own python project.


### How to use

1. Modify `pyproject.toml` according to your project, and optionally rename the `my_project` directory 
2. Enable environment `$ nix develop --impure` to start shell environment (will build all dependencies on first run and after any updates)
3. Update the `lock.json` by running the command generated by dream2nix (see terminal output, `bash -c $(nix-build...` or something similar)

To add new python packages to your project, modify `pyproject.toml` and re-run steps 2 and 3.

To integrate with your IDE, run `which python` from within the activated development environment, and point the interpreter path in your IDE to its output. Make sure to run/start your IDE from within the activated development environment, so it will be able to find the installed python packages.
